Spree Store Credits
===================

[![Build
Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/spree/spree_store_credits.png)](http://travis-ci.org/spree/spree_store_credits)


This Spree extension allows admins to issue arbitrary amounts of store credit to users.

Users can redeem store credit during checkout, as part or full payment for an order.

Also extends My Account page to display outstanding credit balance, and orders that used store credit.

Installation
============

Add spree_store_credits to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_store_credits'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_store_credits:install
```

Configuration
=============

By default Spree Store Credits does not require your order total to be above an amount to apply store credits.

To change this, use the :use_store_credit_minimum preference. For information on setting Spree preferences visit http://guides.spreecommerce.com/developer/preferences.html

One possible implementation looks like this:

```ruby
# app/model/spree/store_credit_decorator.rb

Spree::StoreCredit.class_eval do
  Spree::Config[:use_store_credit_minimum] = 0.01
end

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_store_credits/factories'
```
